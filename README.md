# This repository contains a collection of arcade games

The point of this project is to play around with pygame and get the basics of game development down.

# The recreated games are:
- Snake
- Pong

# The games of my own are :
- Chase

I plan to add more games in the future, including more ambitious ones. 
For now, I project to add the following:
- Tetris
- Flappy Bird
- Asteroids
- Pacman
- Space Invaders
- Breakout

Snake is possible to make into an .exe file using pyinstaller :
```bash
pyinstaller --clean main.spec
```
